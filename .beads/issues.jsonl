The current design is monochromatic with grays, whites, and minimal accent colors. To add color and visual interest, I'll implement a comprehensive color enhancement plan:\n\n1. **Update CSS Variables**: Enhance the color palette in styles.css with vibrant primary colors, better contrast, and semantic color tokens for different UI elements.\n\n2. **Enhance Header Component**: Add gradient backgrounds, improved hover states, and color-coded navigation indicators.\n\n3. **Revitalize Kanban Board**: Implement color-coded columns (Open=blue, In Progress=amber, Done=green), colored badges for priorities, and enhanced card hover states.\n\n4. **Improve Dashboard Cards**: Add subtle gradients, colored icons, and better visual hierarchy with accent colors for stats.\n\n5. **Add Micro-interactions**: Implement smooth color transitions, hover effects, and visual feedback throughout the interface.\n\nThe approach focuses on maintaining readability and accessibility while introducing a cohesive, modern color system that makes the interface more engaging and easier to navigate.","created_at":"2025-12-22T04:48:44Z"}]}
