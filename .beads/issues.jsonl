Implement a copy function using the clipboard API\n3. Provide visual feedback when ID is copied\n\n## Technical Details\n- Use `Copy` icon from lucide-react (already imported)\n- Add copy function using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`\n- Position button inline with the existing ID badge and delete button\n- Show toast or temporary visual confirmation\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `src/components/issue-sheet.tsx` - Add copy button and functionality\n\n## UI/UX Considerations\n- Button should be small and unobtrusive\n- Clear visual feedback when copy succeeds\n- Maintain current header layout\n- Ensure mobile-friendly sizing","created_at":"2025-12-23T15:20:40Z"}]}

This creates poor UX as users wait without feedback.\n\n## Solution Overview\n\nImplement transient cards that provide immediate feedback and handle asynchronous title generation:\n\n1. **Transient State Management**: Add a new state to track generating beads (client-side only)\n2. **UI Updates**: Modify KanbanBoard to display transient cards with loading indicators\n3. **Async Creation Flow**: Create beads immediately with temporary titles, then update with AI-generated titles\n4. **Multiple Concurrent Support**: Handle multiple transient cards updating independently\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Client-side State Management\n- Add transient beads state to track generating items\n- Include unique ID, description, and status for each transient bead\n- Display transient beads in the 'open' column\n\n### 2. Enhanced Kanban Board\n- Modify KanbanBoard to accept and render transient beads\n- Add loading animation/skeleton for transient cards\n- Show \"Generating title...\" indicator\n\n### 3. Async Creation Process\n- Create transient bead immediately when user submits\n- Start title generation in background\n- Update or replace transient card with real bead when complete\n- Handle errors gracefully\n\n### 4. Server Functions\n- Add function to create bead with immediate return (no title generation)\n- Add function to update bead title after generation\n- Keep existing `createBead` for backward compatibility\n\n### 5. Error Handling\n- Handle AI generation failures\n- Allow retry or manual title entry\n- Remove transient cards on failure","created_at":"2025-12-23T15:20:40Z"}]}
